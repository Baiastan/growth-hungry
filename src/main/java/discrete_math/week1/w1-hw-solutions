1.Determining if a Relation is a Function with Mapping

Eugene -> 427-658-2314 is a Function
Janet -> 427-658-3214 is a Function
Rick ->  798-367-8541 is a Function

2. Determine if each of the following equations are functions

a. y = x^2 + 1 -> it is a function. If we plug any number into x, it gives output for value y
b. y^2 = x + 1 -> y = +-sqrt(x + 1) -> it is not a function, since for every x value, there are two possible y values + and -


3. Which functions are surjective (i.e., onto)?

 f : Z => Z defined by f(n) = 3n is not surjective function because:

if we solve for y, n = y/3, only multiples of 3 are in the range which will give whole numbers.
If we plug 1 then it would 1/3 which is not in domain. Thus it is not surjective function

g: {1,2,3} -> {a, b, c} defined by g(1) = c, g(2) = a, g(3) = a is not surjective, because b is not mapped by any input in domain


h: {1,2,3} -> {1,2,3} is surjective because every element is mapped and in the range of codomain and domain


4. Which functions are injective(i.e. one-to-one)

f: f(n) = 3n -> Assume f(n1) = f(n2) -> 3n1 = 2n2 -> n1 = n2 ->
is injective because no two different integers produce the same output. Different inputs must produce different outputs!

g: It is not injetive because 2 and 3 produce a -> different inputs produce same output which is not injective

h: It is injective each input produces unique output


5. True. see solution-5
